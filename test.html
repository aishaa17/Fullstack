<h1>Chocolate Marble cake </h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p> 225g butter, softened <br> 

225g caster sugar <br>

4 eggs <br> 

225g self-raising flour <br> 

3 tbsp milk <br> 

1 tsp vanilla extract <br> 

2 tbsp cocoa powder  </p>


<p>Marble cake is a classic childhood cooking memory. <br> 
Whether using lurid colours for a psychedelic finish, or just chocolate and vanilla, it's a teatime treat.</p>
 
<h3>Method</h3>
 <P>STEP 1
    Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. <br> 
    Grease a 20cm cake tin and line the bottom with a circle of greaseproof paper.

 </P>STEP 2 
    If you want to make life easy, simply put 225g butter, <br> 
    225g caster sugar, 4 eggs, 225g self-raising flour,<br> 
    3 tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract into a food processor and whizz for 1-2 mins until smooth.

<p> STEP 3
    If you prefer to mix by hand, beat 225g butter and 225g caster sugar together,<br> 
    then add 4 eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
    
<p> STEP 4
    Fold through 225g self-raising flour,<br>
    3 tbsp milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract until the mixture is smooth.</p>

<p> STEP 5
    Divide the mixture between 2 bowls. Stir 2 tbsp cocoa powder into the mixture in one of the bowls. <br> 
    Take 2 spoons and use them to dollop the chocolate and vanilla cake mixes into the tin alternately.</p>

<p>STEP 6
    When all the mixture has been used up (and if young kids are doing this, you’ll need to ensure the base of the tin is fairly evenly covered),<br> 
    tap the bottom on your work surface to ensure that there aren’t any air bubbles.</p>

<p>STEP 7
    Take a skewer and swirl it around the mixture in the tin a few times to create a marbled effect.</p>
    
<p>STEP 8
    Bake the cake for 45-55 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Turn out onto a cooling rack and leave to cool.<br> 
    Will keep for 3 days in an airtight container or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
